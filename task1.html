    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
      SBRR Mahajana First Grade College is at an epochal moment in its cherished
      history, since it was founded in 1982, born as an offspring of Mahajana
      Education Society (1937). It started as a Womenâ€™s College offering B.A and
      B.Com programmes and was admitted to the Grant-in-aid scheme in the year
      1987, and in 1988 became a co-educational institution. As the college made
      rapid strides, being committed to academic excellence and qualitative
      development, B.Sc. programme was introduced in the year 1988, BBM
      programme was started in 1994, followed by Biotechnology, Microbiology,
      Biochemistry combinations in B.Sc. in 2004. The BCA programme was
      introduced in 2008.

      From a modest beginning the college has today branched out into a well
      reputed institution with its multi-dimensional growth. As a logical
      perseverance of its primary desire, on the threshold of the 21st Century,
      the college started PG programmes in 1999 from a new campus situated five
      kms. away from the main Campus. The institution now offers post-graduate
      degree and diploma courses in thirteen disciplines, which include Computer
      Application, Biotechnology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Computer Science,
      Information Technology, Business Administration, Commerce, Social Work,
      Chemistry, Economics and Tourism Administration. It is poised to start
      more number of new programmes in the years to come. It is granted
      Community College under the UGC Scheme, offering Diploma in Hospitality &
      Catering and Diploma in Museology. This programme is meant for the general
      public as well as for the interested students of the college.
